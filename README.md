#Phase Plane Application

This program displays a vector field correspoinding to a given two dimensional system and allows for trajectories to be plotted via mouseclick. Trajectories are calculated using a second order Runge-Kutta method with an adaptive stepsize. Users can select from a selection of preloaded vector functions or modify coefficients for a simpler linear system.

You can find the program displayed [here](https://mitchellf.github.io/pplane/).
